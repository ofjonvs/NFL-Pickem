# NFL-Pickem

NFL pickem program that uses google sheets and text files to track weekly picks

Features hash maps, string manipulation, 2d arrays, web scraping, web automation, file processing

Uses google API. If you want to make your own version where you can create the weekly forms in 2 clicks 
you're going to need to go through the process of creating your own API project in google cloud.

When making the picks text file (where you input your predictions/winners), the first line will be "Week X", 
the second line will be the persons name followed by all the teams they have winning for that given week. 
Team names must be spelled correctly and are not case sensitive.

example:
